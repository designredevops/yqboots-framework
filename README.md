# YQBoots Framework - Build production-ready Spring application
<p>an Open Source Project built on <a href="https://spring.io/spring-boot" title="Spring Boot">Spring Boot</a>.
It allows you to build production-ready Spring application,getting you up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Some one may ask why not fully automated? This is because the project in real world may change quickly,
I think the fully automated will be the constraints when business grows, so keep it thin to respond to the changes.</p>
